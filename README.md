CesiumKit
=========
Objective-C/iOS port of the [Cesium](http://cesiumjs.org) WebGL virtual globe project.

Status
------
Currently renderer and core are incomplete. Minimal untextured globe support is the first priority.

I'm currenty not going to implement 2D or Columbus view as these aren't priorities for the personal project this is intended for. However community contributions and feedback are welcome.

Testing
-------
Nothing user-friendly yet. Likely to be via providing CSScene with a GLKView or EAGLContext. Once there's something to render I'll create a simple UIApplication test runner.
