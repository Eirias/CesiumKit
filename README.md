CesiumKit
=========
iOS/Swift port of the [Cesium](http://cesiumjs.org) WebGL virtual globe project.

Status
------
Renderer and core are largely complete. Minimal untextured globe support is functional.
Current efforts are focused on implementing textures and the Bing maps provider, then expanding the camera controls with a view to adding gesture support.
I'm eventually hoping for near complete globe support with CZML interoperability with cesium.js.
Community contributions and feedback are welcome.

Testing
-------
Build and run CesiumKitRunner. At the moment the only external API are global object creation and render calls, and I'm hoping to keep things simple for implementation.
