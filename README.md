CesiumKit
=========
iOS/Swift port of the [Cesium](http://cesiumjs.org) WebGL virtual globe project.

Status
------
Currently renderer and core are partially complete. Minimal untextured globe support nearly functional.

I'm eventually hoping for near complete globe support with CZML interoperability with cesium.js.
Community contributions and feedback are welcome.

Testing
-------
Build and run CesiumKitRunner. At the moment the only external API are global object creation and render calls, and I'm hoping to keep things simple for implementation.
